# SerialPortUtility

Serial Port Utility is a small utility program for communicating via serial ports (COM ports).

The program is essentially meant to be a free basic replacement for the old an retired HyperTerminal (last release with Windows XP).

The program targets .NET Framework 4.5 (supported on Windows 7, 8 and 10)

The code itself serves as a reference implementation of the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern.

The application is as of yet still an unfinished work in progress. Please post any bugs and requests under the Issues section.

Check the develop branch for the latest version.
